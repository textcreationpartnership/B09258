            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A HUE and CRY AFTER LAMBERT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OOPE, hoope, stop him, if you meet one that was lately evacuated out of the Tower; having <hi>afront</hi> of an Anabaptist Hue a Fift Monarchy <hi>Nose,</hi> a <hi>Beard</hi> after the reformed fashion cut into <hi>Knipperdolings</hi> mode, by the directions of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leydon</hi> one of the Sons of <hi>Sion,</hi> you may know him by his head composed of the <hi>shreads</hi> of factions, a gate wholly Phanatique, he hath <hi>Naylor</hi> on his tongue, a <hi>Protector</hi> in his head; in short he is a Monster begot by the Phanatique <hi>Lechery</hi> on the Lacivious <hi>RƲMP:</hi> his Doublet is of <hi>Lindsey-woolsey,</hi> intimating the <hi>variety</hi> of his Fortunes, he weares Yellow Ribbons of <hi>OLIVERS</hi> dye, and Red Breaches, wherein he danced lately upon the Rope through the window at the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a black cloake bestowed on him at the <hi>RƲMPS</hi> Funerall, he is <hi>shod</hi> with ambition, and hopes to get on <hi>OLIVERS</hi> Boots, his Spurres gingle to the tune of any Psalm; he weares a long Sword of <hi>destruction,</hi> which he threatens to <hi>draw</hi> upon us. Lay hold on him, if you let him goe you dye.</p>
            <p>You will find him either amongst the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of <hi>Handy-crafts</hi> men, whose Phanatique zeale made them aspire to the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and renouncing the relation to the <hi>Awle</hi> and the <hi>Loome</hi> to venture the setting up a <hi>new Exchange</hi> for Religion, at the charge of the honest party.</p>
            <p>But some say he stole away by <hi>Sir Georges device,</hi> conceiving mor safety in the <hi>Petticoate</hi> then <hi>Breeches,</hi> look well into the Coventicles, and if you find a woman in apparell with the face of a Generall make sure. Let neither the <hi>Pharasaicall</hi> turning up the white of the eye delude you; nor the <hi>quai it device</hi> of a groaning devotion deceive you; nor the <hi>counterfeit</hi> current of sanctified teares beguile you.</p>
            <p>But if he cannot be found within any of the Saints meeting places, then he is gone to rement the divisions amongst the Schismaticall <hi>Fry,</hi> and to breach upon the Carkasse of the Phanatique interest, which if he revives he will venture one bout more with the <hi>folkes</hi> of the Citty for a Crown, though he gets but a crackt <hi>one</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>For all this, you may probably find him in the <hi>Villages</hi> preaching the doctrine of <hi>Repentance,</hi> for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Ch— is at hand. But let that passe, let us put you in mind of him as a Phanatique <hi>Cardinall, Pope</hi> elective, and so designed by the Schismaticall <hi>Conclave,</hi> well if <hi>John</hi> be changed into <hi>Peter,</hi> we must all hold our Religion by <hi>pattern</hi> from him, our faith must put on the Phanatique <hi>Livery,</hi> or be interdicted heaven, and tis he alone must make us free <hi>denisons</hi> there. Behold the State we shall be reduced unto, if <hi>Wimbleton</hi> house proves a <hi>Vatiran,</hi> and all this through one sprung from the putrified part of a <hi>puritane,</hi> and afterwards impt upon the stock of <hi>Schisme,</hi> by our moderne <hi>Knipperdolings,</hi> and fenced about with the quickset hedge of Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and Thornes, so that none could approach it to remove it, untill the heat of the rising <hi>Sun</hi> set the Bryars on fire, and so made it accessible, which was fince transplanted into the Tower, from whence the soyle being averse to its temper, it transposed, but whithcr no one knowes.</p>
